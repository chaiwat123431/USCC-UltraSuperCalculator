# Ultra Super Calculator (USCC) CPU Simulator

## Extended Description
The Ultra Super Calculator (USCC) is a Python mini CPU simulator demonstrating the interaction between registers and the ALU. It executes 32-bit binary instructions to perform Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, stores results in history, and displays them in the terminal. This project helps understand basic CPU architecture and instruction processing.

## Features
- 22 number registers and 10 history registers
- Supports Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Processes 32-bit binary instructions
- Stores calculation history
- Displays results in terminal

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run "python cpu_simulator.py"
3. Observe calculations performed based on binary instructions

## Example Instructions
- Store 10 in a register: "000001000000000000000000001010"
- Add two registers (R1 + R2): "000000000010001000000000100000"
